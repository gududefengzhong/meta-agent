"""Inline permission protocol domain types (Phase δ-1).

Different mechanism than the γ-A async ``AWAITING_APPROVAL``
workflow:

* γ-A: task state transitions to ``AWAITING_APPROVAL``, worker
  releases resources, operator visits a separate UI / API, the
  approval flows back via a different channel, task resumes minutes
  to hours later. Right for high-stakes long-running async reviews
  (PR-style sign-off).
* δ-1 inline: the agent is mid-loop, hits a sensitive action,
  emits a prompt to a connected client, blocks for *seconds* on a
  decision, then continues.

The two coexist — operators pick per ``PermissionMode``.
